Configure a Janus Orchestrator and an OpenStack Location
========================================================

Now we must define a location (where we will actually deploy applications). In Alien4Cloud every location is managed by an orchestrator.

Configure a Janus Orchestrator
------------------------------

To create an orchestrator, go to |AdminBtn| and in the |OrchBtn| sub-menu. Create an orchestrator named ``Janus`` with the plugin
``Janus Orchestrator Factory : 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT``.

At this moment your orchestrator is created but not enabled. Click on your orchestrator to see the information page, and then
click on the configuration menu icon |OrchConfigBtn|. In the Driver configuration part, add the URL
(should respect the format: ``http://janus-ip:8800``) of your Janus server and return to the previous page to enable your orchestrator.


Configure an OpenStack Location
-------------------------------

Once your orchestrator is created and enabled, go to the locations page by clicking on |OrchLocBtn|. Create a location named ``OpenStack``
and select ``openstack`` on the infrastructure type drop-down. The details page of your location should appears. Go to |OrchLocODRBtn| and
add the following resources:

  * janus.nodes.openstack.PublicNetwork
  * janus.nodes.openstack.Compute

Click on the network and set ``floating_network_name`` to the name of your OpenStack public network for the tenant where the Janus instance
is deployed.

Click on the compute and set the ``image`` to the id of your image in OpenStack (in order to use our samples in next sections, please use
an Ubuntu 14.04+ or Centos 7.2+ image), the ``flavor`` to ``3`` (medium for a default OpenStack config), the ``user`` to a user available in
your image (generally ``ubuntu`` for Ubuntu cloud images). Finally, set ``key_pair`` to the OpenStack keypair that correspond to the
private key that you stored under ``~/.ssh/janus.pem`` during your Janus server setup.
